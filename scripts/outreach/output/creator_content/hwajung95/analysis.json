  "appearance": "Young adult female in her early 20s, oval face with soft features, long straight jet-black hair with full blunt bangs, porcelain-fair skin tone with a natural rosy blush, and a slender, delicate build.",
  "fashion_style": "Minimalist and traditional-leaning. Prefers clean lines, soft fabrics like linen or silk, and a palette of whites and creams. Often styled in modern interpretations of hanbok or elegant, understated blouses that emphasize a 'clean girl' look.",
  "aesthetic": "Soft-focus and ethereal with a romantic, nostalgic mood. The visual style is characterized by a muted, warm color palette dominated by creamy whites and soft pinks, contrasted against deep black hair for a striking yet gentle look.",
  "best_setting": "A sun-drenched traditional Korean hanok courtyard with wooden textures, or a minimalist modern interior featuring large windows, light wood furniture, and ceramic accents that reflect the premium nature of the brand.",
  "photography_notes": "Eye-level portraits with a shallow depth of field to create a dreamy bokeh effect. Use soft, diffused natural light to enhance the skin's glow. The mood should be serene and elegant, capturing quiet, candid moments of pouring or appreciating the texture of the makgeolli."
