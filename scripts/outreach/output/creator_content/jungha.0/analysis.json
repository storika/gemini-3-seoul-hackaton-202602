  "appearance": "Young woman in her early 20s with an oval face shape and delicate, soft features. She has long, dark brown to black hair with a natural, slightly wavy texture and a middle part. Her skin tone is fair with a smooth, matte finish, and she has a slender, petite build.",
  "fashion_style": "Casual streetwear with a retro-vintage influence. She is seen wearing a raglan-style graphic t-shirt with contrasting sleeves, suggesting a preference for 'effortless cool' and comfortable, youth-oriented fashion that blends nostalgia with modern trends.",
  "aesthetic": "Lo-fi, nostalgic, and moody. The visual style mimics vintage film or early 2000s digital photography, characterized by a warm but slightly underexposed color palette, soft grain, and a playful, DIY digital-native vibe indicated by the hand-drawn blue flower overlay.",
  "best_setting": "A minimalist yet cozy urban apartment, a trendy 'hidden' Seoul cafe with industrial accents, or a dimly lit premium bar that balances traditional Korean elements with modern, sleek design.",
  "photography_notes": "Eye-level, intimate framing with a soft-focus or slight motion blur to enhance the 'candid' feel. Lighting should mimic a point-and-shoot flash or soft, warm indoor ambient light to maintain an authentic, 'off-duty' influencer mood."
