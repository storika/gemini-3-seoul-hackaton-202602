  "appearance": "Young adult woman in her early 20s with an oval face shape and delicate, soft features. She has long, straight dark brown to black hair with subtle face-framing layers. Her skin tone is fair with a smooth, porcelain finish, and she has a slender, petite build.",
  "fashion_style": "Casual Gen-Z streetwear with a 'Newtro' (new-retro) influence. She favors comfortable, vintage-inspired pieces like raglan-sleeve graphic tees, relaxed silhouettes, and a mix of sporty and urban elements that feel effortless.",
  "aesthetic": "Lo-fi, nostalgic film aesthetic. The visual mood is intimate and slightly moody, characterized by a muted color palette, soft shadows, and a 'digital camera' look that prioritizes authenticity over high-gloss perfection.",
  "best_setting": "A contemporary 'Newtro' space that blends tradition with modern design—such as a minimalist modern Hanok with warm wood accents, a sleek premium makgeolli bar with ambient lighting, or a stylish, dimly lit home interior.",
  "photography_notes": "Direct flash photography with slight vignetting and fine film grain to mimic a vintage point-and-shoot camera. Use eye-level or slightly high camera angles to capture a candid, unposed feel. The lighting should be low-key to emphasize the premium, artisanal mood of the brand while keeping her look approachable."
