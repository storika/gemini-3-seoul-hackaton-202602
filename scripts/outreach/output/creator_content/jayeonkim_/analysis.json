  "appearance": "East Asian female in her late 20s to early 30s. She has a refined oval face shape with high cheekbones and a sharp jawline. Her hair is a rich dark brown, styled in a sleek, low ponytail with elegant side-swept bangs. She has a fair, luminous skin tone and a slender, graceful build.",
  "fashion_style": "Sophisticated minimalism and 'quiet luxury.' She favors clean lines and solid colors, as seen in the high-neck black turtleneck. The style is timeless, professional, and understatedly chic, avoiding loud patterns or logos.",
  "aesthetic": "Polished, serene, and high-end. The visual mood is calm and composed, utilizing a neutral color palette of charcoal, black, and warm skin tones. The composition is focused and uncluttered, emphasizing elegance and premium quality.",
  "best_setting": "Minimalist modern Hanok (traditional Korean house) interiors, upscale contemporary bars with natural wood and stone textures, or a sun-drenched, high-end minimalist kitchen. These settings align with the premium, artisanal branding of Boksoondoga.",
  "photography_notes": "Soft, directional lighting to accentuate facial structure and skin texture. Use a shallow depth of field to keep the focus entirely on the subject and the product. Camera angles should be at eye level or slightly below to convey confidence and grace. The mood should be sophisticated, inviting, and tranquil."
