# Content Guidelines: @jungha.0 × 복순도가

## Brand Fit Analysis
@jungha.0 (Hayoung) serves as the "Aesthetic Anchor" for this campaign. While her engagement rate (0.74%) suggests a passive but visually-driven audience, her **236,000 followers** provide the necessary reach to establish Boksoondoga as a high-fashion lifestyle staple.

*   **Editorial Synergy:** Her high-fashion, studio-lit aesthetic perfectly mirrors Boksoondoga’s "Modern Craft" value. She doesn't just "post" products; she integrates them into a curated visual narrative.
*   **Demographic Match:** Her focus on beauty and fashion attracts the **25-35 urban female demographic**, who are the primary targets for premium, low-ABV (5-6%) sparkling rice wine.
*   **The "Luxury" Halo:** With a 45% collab ratio, Hayoung’s audience is accustomed to seeing her with premium brands. By positioning Boksoondoga alongside her usual luxury fashion content, the brand is elevated from "traditional alcohol" to "lifestyle accessory."

## Recommended Content Themes

1.  **"The Modern Ritual" (Reels/Video):** Focus on the unique "opening ceremony" of Boksoondoga Sparkling. The natural carbonation requires a slow, rhythmic opening. This fits Hayoung’s slow-paced, minimalist video style. 
    *   *Visuals:* Close-ups of the bubbles rising, her hands (well-manicured) turning the cap, and the crisp sound of the carbonation.
2.  **"Jeju Soul, City Heart" (Carousel):** A high-fashion editorial shot in a minimalist urban setting (e.g., a modern balcony or a clean-lined interior). Hayoung in "Quiet Luxury" attire holding the bottle like a high-end perfume or accessory.
3.  **"The After-Work Wind-down":** A more intimate, "behind-the-scenes" model life look. Showing the Boksoondoga Son Makgeolli paired with a simple, aesthetic cheese plate after a long shoot day.

## Content Do's
*   **Focus on the "Champagne" Factor:** Treat the Sparkling Makgeolli as a premium alternative to Champagne. Use flutes or clean glassware.
*   **Minimalist Backgrounds:** Use the brand colors (Warm White, Volcanic Black). Stone textures, linen, and soft shadows are encouraged.
*   **Show the Texture:** For the Son Makgeolli, capture the creamy, unfiltered "cloudiness" of the liquid.
*   **Natural Lighting:** Even if shot in a studio, the lighting should mimic the soft, golden hour glow of Jeju Island.
*   **English/Korean Mix:** Maintain her signature bilingual caption style to appeal to her international and domestic fashion-forward followers.

## Content Don'ts
*   **No "Anju" Clutter:** Avoid traditional, heavy Korean pub food (No *pajeon* or *jeyuk-bokkeum*). Keep food styling minimal—think a single pear, a piece of sourdough, or premium cheese.
*   **No "Party" Vibes:** Avoid neon lights, crowded tables, or "cheersing" with large groups. This is about personal indulgence and craft.
*   **No Heavy Filters:** Avoid high-contrast or "beauty" filters that distort the natural ivory color of the Makgeolli.
*   **No Generic Posing:** Avoid the "holding the bottle next to the face" smile. Opt for candid, editorial movements.

## Posting Schedule & Format
*   **Primary Format:** 1x Instagram Feed Carousel (4-5 slides). 
    *   Slide 1: Hero shot (Hayoung + Product). 
    *   Slide 2: Detail shot of the bottle/label. 
    *   Slide 3: Pouring shot (Focus on bubbles). 
    *   Slide 4: Lifestyle/Atmosphere shot.
*   **Secondary Format:** 1x Instagram Reel (15 seconds). 
    *   Focus on the ASMR of opening the sparkling bottle and the aesthetics of the Jeju-inspired packaging.
*   **Timing:** Thursday evening (20:00 - 21:30). This hits her audience as they plan their "home-cafe" or "home-bar" weekend vibes.
