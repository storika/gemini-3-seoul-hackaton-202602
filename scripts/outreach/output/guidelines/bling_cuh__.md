# Content Guidelines: @bling_cuh__ × 복순도가

## Brand Fit Analysis
@bling_cuh__ (Bling Chu) represents the **"Trusted Reviewer"** archetype within this campaign. While other creators may focus on high-fashion aesthetics, Bling Chu provides the social proof necessary to convert interest into sales. 

*   **Engagement Leadership:** Her 1.81% engagement rate is the highest among the campaign cohort, indicating an audience that doesn't just scroll past her content but actively reads and trusts her recommendations. 
*   **Conversion Expertise:** An 88% collaboration ratio suggests she has mastered the art of the "shoppable" review. Her followers are conditioned to look to her for "the next big thing" in lifestyle and beauty.
*   **Demographic Alignment:** Her use of Korean slang and relatable humor resonates perfectly with the 25-35 urban female target, breaking the "stiff" stereotype of traditional liquor and making Boksoondoga feel like a modern "flex" (플렉스) for a cozy night in.

## Recommended Content Themes
1.  **"The Champagne of Makgeolli" Unboxing:** A high-energy, sensory-focused review highlighting the natural carbonation. Focus on the sound of the bottle opening and the visual of the "vortex" as the sediment mixes naturally.
2.  **Premium Pairing (Anju) Experiment:** Bling Chu tests 3 different types of food with Boksoondoga—ranging from traditional Korean pancakes to modern "wine snacks" like Brie cheese or prosciutto—to prove its versatility.
3.  **The "Work-Hard, Drink-Better" Reward:** A lifestyle vlog style "Get Ready to Relax With Me" (GRWM-style) where she transitions from her professional day to a premium "Home-ba" (Home Bar) experience.
4.  **Honest Comparison:** A "Why this is different" video. She can compare the creamy *Son Makgeolli* vs. the crisp *Sparkling* version, giving her followers a "Which one are you?" guide.

## Content Do's
*   **Emphasize the "Natural Pop":** Boksoondoga is famous for its carbonation. Capture the slow-opening ritual—it’s the brand’s signature "ASMR" moment.
*   **Use Signature Slang:** Incorporate her usual witty tone (e.g., "인생 막걸리 찾음," "이거 진짜 고급진 맛임") to keep the review authentic.
*   **Focus on the "Jeju" Origin:** Mention the premium Jeju rice and the 2012 heritage to justify the premium price point.
*   **Highlight the Bottle Design:** The sleek, modern bottle fits her "lifestyle/beauty" aesthetic perfectly. Show it off as a home decor piece.
*   **Clear Call to Action:** Given her high collab ratio, her audience expects a "where to buy" link. Ensure the path to purchase is clear.

## Content Don'ts
*   **No "Pojangmacha" Vibes:** Avoid green plastic cups or messy table settings. Maintain the "Premium/Artisanal" visual standard.
*   **Avoid Over-filtered Visuals:** Her strength is "Honest Reviews." Keep the lighting natural and the product colors true to life (Warm white/Soft gold).
*   **Don't Rush the Pour:** The "sediment dance" (natural mixing) is a key selling point. Don't shake the bottle—show how it mixes itself.
*   **No Generic Backgrounds:** Avoid messy rooms or generic office settings. Use clean, minimalist backgrounds that match the #F5F0E8 (Warm White) brand palette.

## Posting Schedule & Format
*   **Primary Format:** **Instagram Reels (60s).** Essential for capturing the "pop" of the carbonation and her fast-paced, humorous commentary.
*   **Secondary Format:** **Carousel Post.** 5-7 slides including: 1. Hero lifestyle shot, 2. Texture/Pouring close-up, 3. Food pairing, 4. Nutritional/Ingredient info (no additives!), 5. "Bling Chu's Pick" summary.
*   **Timing:** **Thursday or Friday Evening (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM).** This is when her 25-35 urban professional audience is looking for weekend "Home-ba" inspiration.
